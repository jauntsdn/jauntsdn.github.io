      <description>Motivation In practice reactive applications - as a method to model software and programming paradigm of composable flow controlled streams - viable mainly within JVM context.
It has necessary ecosystem provided by several competing platforms: reactive-streams-common from helidon se by Oracle, akka-streams from akka by Lightbend, project reactor from spring boot by Pivotal, and standalone community-maintained rxjava.
Libraries are interoperable on same VM because their APIs semantically conform to reactive-streams specification, with 3 of 4 having binary compatibility - streams may be combined directly without writing any adapter code.</description>
